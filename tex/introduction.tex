CowHub is an alternative solution to the current tagging system (the ''system'') that has been widely used in the cattle industry. The current system, which CowHub will replace, is thought have the following undesirable characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Inhumane}: tag needs to be physically installed (pierced) into the ear of the cattle
	\item \textbf{Inefficient}: registration and the production of tags is time-consuming
	\item \textbf{Unsafe}: tags, and other physical additions, can be easily removed, removing a farmer's only record of ownership of their cattle
	\item \textbf{Obsolete}: with contention from the public, the system has not been updated or reviewed in a significant period of time
\end{itemize}

CowHub introduces a new and modern way to get around the aforementioned issues. CowHub is able to identify a cattle by using its biometric features\footnote{The muzzle as of now.}. This approach is non-intrusive as as does not relly on any physically attachment such as a tag to recognize cattle. Also, the biometrics features used are unique and do not change over time. Biometric recognition techniques have been widely used to prevent fraud, enhance security, and curtail identity theft\cite{biometrics}. Thus, the identity and integrity of each individual is guaranteed to be preserved.
